## Get Started
First of all, it is necessary to create a virtualEnv and install all the dependencies from the 'requirements.txt' file. Pay attention that pytorch is also listed inside the file, but it is better to install it before from the official website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

## Structure
Inside the folder: 'src' there is the main code. The 'preprocessing.py' file is useful in order to download all fasta and PDB information for the necessary protein.
